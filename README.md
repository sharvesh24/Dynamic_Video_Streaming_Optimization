# Dynamic_Video_Streaming_Optimization


Project Overview


Problem: Video Streaming Quality vs Network Condition


Solution


-> Optimize Buffering in real time
-> Adjust Video Quality based on Network Conditions
-> Prevent interruptions while maximizing quality


Algorithmic Approach


Divide and Conquer Approach


-> Split the video into smaller segments (chunks) for efficient loading
-> Process and load each chunk in parallel based on network speed


Greedy Approach


-> Always select the highest possible quality that the network can support.
-> If bandwidth drops, immediately switch to a lower resolution to prevent buffering![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a22cf0c2-8906-4c40-a99d-eddc7fe3896d)
