Problem: Video Streaming Quality vs Network Condition


# Solution


-> Optimize Buffering in real time
-> Adjust Video Quality based on Network Conditions
-> Prevent interruptions while maximizing quality

# Divide and Conquer Approach


-> Split the video into smaller segments (chunks) for efficient loading
-> Process and load each chunk in parallel based on network speed


# Greedy Approach


-> Always select the highest possible quality that the network can support.
-> If bandwidth drops, immediately switch to a lower resolution to prevent buffering.
